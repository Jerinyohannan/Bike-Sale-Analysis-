# Bike Sales Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing bike sales data using Microsoft Excel. The dataset consists of various factors related to customers and their purchasing behavior.

# Dataset
The dataset is stored in Bike-Sale-Data-Project.xlsx and includes the following columns:

* ID
* Marital Status
* Gender
* Income
* Children
* Education
* Occupation
* Home Owner
* Cars
* Commute Distance
* Region
* Age
* Age Bracket
* Purchased Bike
# Data Cleaning
The dataset underwent thorough cleaning to ensure data quality:

* Removed 26 duplicate entries using Excel's conditional formatting and the remove duplicates function.
# Data Exploration
To better analyze the data, several new columns were added:

* Average Range
* Income Range
  
Numerous pivot charts were created to gain insights into the data:

* Analyzed customer behavior based on different factors such as age, occupation, and income.
* Created charts to understand the impact of these factors on bike purchasing behavior.
Observations
The dashboard revealed several key insights:

* Most bike purchases were made in North America.
* A significant number of customers who purchased bikes were bachelors or had partial college education, with 55% of bachelor customers purchasing bikes.
* Bikes were predominantly purchased by customers living within a short commute distance (0-1 mile).
* Customers who bought bikes generally had no car or only one car.
* The income range of most bike buyers was
between $21,000 and $40,000.

* Professional and skilled manual job holders were the primary bike purchasers.
# Conclusion
Based on the analysis, several conclusions can be drawn:

* Customers with professional jobs and good qualifications are more likely to purchase bikes.
* Bikes are more frequently purchased by customers with shorter commute distances.
* The North America region has the highest bike purchase rate. Efforts should be made to boost sales in other regions, especially the Pacific region.
# Dashboard
A dashboard was created to visualize these findings. An image of the dashboard is included in the repository for reference.
